# Voztra Politik

This application was made for politicians, so that their campaign management could be done all online and their information could be easily handled all in one place.

### Functionalities:

- Fully responsive.
- Implemented with the Laravel Model-View-Controller architecture.
- CRUD functionality with MySQL for many different tables.
- AJAX response in a lot of the application (AJAX search, for example)
- User system with different levels of access for different types of users.
- Deployment with Heroku, and database hosted with Heroku add-on ClearDB.
- Interactive SVG maps.

When accessing you can select any section of the map, or search it (we recommend "abejorral"):

### To use:
Clone this repository and follow along with the implementation notes. Those notes are mostly for myself so my apologies if they're not very clear.

### Note:
This is very much not finished, although I don't know if I'll keep working on it. So you may encounter bugs.
